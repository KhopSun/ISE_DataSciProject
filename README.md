# ðŸ“š Research Paper Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard built using **Streamlit** to analyze research papers, providing insights into publications, authors, affiliations, and leveraging **machine learning** to predict research categories.

---

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**
This project is a part of Data Science Course at Chulalongkorn University, aiming to streamline the analysis of research papers using a data-driven dashboard. The dashboard offers five main sections:

1. **Home:** Overview of key metrics and trends.
2. **Publication:** Detailed analysis of publication trends and impact.
3. **Author:** Insights into author contributions and collaboration networks.
4. **Affiliation:** Visualization of institutional and geographical research impact.
5. **ML (Machine Learning):** Predicts research categories using an AI model.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter research data by date and subject area.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Line charts, bar charts, pie charts, network graphs, and geolocation maps.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Predicts the research subject area from text using a pre-trained model.

---

## ðŸ§  **Machine Learning Model**
The **GopherSubjectArea** model, hosted on **Hugging Face**, classifies research abstracts into six categories:
- Sciences
- Health and Medicine
- Engineering and Technology
- Arts and Social Sciences and Humanities
- Mathematics and Multidisciplinary
- Economic and Business and Finance

---

## ðŸ§° **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend & Dashboard:** Streamlit
- **Data Handling:** Pandas
- **Visualizations:** Matplotlib, Plotly, Pydeck, Altair
- **Machine Learning:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Database:** MongoDB (optional)

- **Trends:** Publication trends over time.

### **2. Publication**
- **Growth Over Time:** Line chart of publication volume.
- **Subject Area Distribution:** Treemap showing research fields.

### **3. Author**
- **Top Authors:** Bar chart of most productive authors.
- **Collaboration Network:** Visualization of co-authorship.

### **4. Affiliation**
- **Affiliation Map:** Interactive map showing research contributions by country.
- **Top Institutions:** Bar chart of active affiliations.

### **5. ML (Machine Learning)**
- **Text Classification:** Predicts research category based on input abstract.
- **Model Performance:** Displays accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
